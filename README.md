 Assignment IT212: Polymorphic Zoo
 
This is a simple Java program that shows the functionality of Polymorphism in Java, and demonstrates polymorphism using a zoo scenario.

🚀 How It Works

The `Zoo` program allows you to simulate animal sounds in a zoo setting. It includes a base class `Animal` with derived classes representing specific animals like Lion, Elephant, and Monkey. Each animal can make its unique sound, and you can control how many times an animal produces its sound.

🛠 Features

- Base class `Animal` with name setting and sound methods.
- Derived classes for Lion, Elephant, and Monkey with unique sounds.
- Method overloading to repeat animal sounds based on input.
- Main method in `ZooDemo` to showcase animal sounds in a zoo collection.

▶️ How to Run

    Clone this repository.
    Makesure all the class/object files in the same folder.
    Compile the program:

javac ZooDemo.java
java ZooDemo.java

    Enter number of sound when prompted.

📌 Example Output
